This is here for historical refence only 12/2023.

An opinionated framework with a goal of rapidly creating a minimally lovable product.

Version: Pre-Alpha - not suitable for human eyes.


Mission
-------
Provide a library to very quickly develop minimally lovalable
products that can realistically transform to scalable, secure,
and maintainable code. 

Motivation
----------
* I've programmed in PHP, on and off, since 2002, which is way before 
composer and other frameworks existed in any meaningful form.
I wanted to start ripping out some mini-framework ideas I've
used in my own projects and expose them to the sunlight. 
* This also acts like a good forcing function for me to start 
using more best-practices like monolog, instead of me own
custom logging, error checking, etc.
* After recently reviewing Laravel, and revisting Django, I'm
still surprised how difficult it is to gin up a usable website.
I think I have useful ideas to apply in this area, so this project will
see if I can get those ideas out of my old projects and out of my
head, and into reusable code.  This will also see if these
are just good ideas in theory, or if they are also good ideas in
practice.


Roadmap Vision
--------------
 * Play nice with WordPress...    
    * Via Bedrock https://roots.io/bedrock/
    * http://wecodemore.github.io/wpstarter/
    * Via a minimally invasive install
 * Play nice with Laravel
 * Eventually use its own reference framework with opinionated 
 routing, cms, and authentication
